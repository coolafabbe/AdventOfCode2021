make list of segments for every number
create empty remapped_nums list
//make dictionary with expected occurences of every segment
for every line, loop through the signals:
    if length == [2, 4, 3, 7] (for 1, 4, 7, 8):
        add signal to remapped_nums list
    add diff between remapped_nums 1 and 7 to [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9]
    add diff between remapped_nums 1 and 4 to [5, 6, 9]
    add remapped_nums[1] to remapped_nums[9]
